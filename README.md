Stacks: Flask, Javascript, SQLAlchemy, Socketio

I'm bulding a website so that it has:
- users,
- custom email verification,
- password reset option,
- quick chat with users (snapchat like),
- friends,
- notifications (page, email),
- ability to post ( I don't know what yet, and how to make it unique ),
- ability to create events ( same thing, ideas are yet to come),
- custom themes,
- its width responsive,
- good scalable database models ( so at least there won't be problems with that in the future ),
- animations,
- ...

Found out that React solves a lot of problems that come using pure JavaScript.
Currently on a break due to me learning React.


Goal:
APi built with flask + React as front-end
Might use FastAPI instead of Flask.
